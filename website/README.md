# LLM Studio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Backend / Gateway configuration

This UI expects the Go BFF to be reachable (used for login/session + issuing the LLM Gateway auth cookie), and the LLM Gateway HTTP service to be reachable (OpenAI-compatible `/v1/*`).

Environment variables:

- Client-side code may also use `NEXT_PUBLIC_LLM_GATEWAY_HTTP_BASE_URL`.

The dashboard chat page streams responses directly from the browser to the LLM Gateway's OpenAI-compatible API (`/v1/chat/completions`).

Authentication is handled by calling the BFF endpoint `/api/llm/token`, which issues an HttpOnly cookie consumed by the gateway. Client requests to the gateway include this cookie via `credentials: "include"`.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
